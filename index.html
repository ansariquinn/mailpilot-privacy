  <h1>Privacy Policy for MailPilot</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <p>
    MailPilot processes the text content of your Gmail messages solely to generate AI-based reply suggestions.
    The extension does not collect, log, or permanently store any personal data, email content, or message metadata.
  </p>

  <p>
    MailPilot communicates securely with its backend API (<code>smart-reply-zaua.onrender.com</code>) only for the
    purpose of generating a reply or summary. All communication is encrypted using HTTPS and is used only to
    fulfill the user's request.
  </p>

  <p>
    MailPilot does not sell, share, or transfer user data to any third party. We do not use your information
    for analytics, marketing, or profiling. All processing happens transiently while generating a reply or summary.
  </p>

  <h2>Local Storage of Preferences</h2>
  <p>
    MailPilot uses Chrome’s built-in <code>storage</code> API to save small user interface preferences such as
    whether introductory tooltips have been dismissed or other non-personal settings. This data is stored
    <strong>locally on your device only</strong>, is minimal and non-sensitive, and is never transmitted to any
    server or shared with any third party.
  </p>

  <p>
    MailPilot does not store email content, Gmail account information, or any other personal data in Chrome storage.
  </p>

    If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact us at
