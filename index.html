  <h1>Privacy Policy for MailPilot</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <p>
    MailPilot processes the text content of your Gmail messages solely to generate AI-based reply suggestions.
    The extension does not collect, log, or permanently store any personal data, email content, or message metadata.
  </p>

  <p>
    MailPilot communicates securely with its backend API (<code>smart-reply-zaua.onrender.com</code>) only for the
    purpose of generating a reply. All communication is encrypted using HTTPS.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not sell, share, or transfer user data to any third party. We do not use your information for analytics,
    marketing, or profiling. All processing happens transiently while generating a reply.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact us at
